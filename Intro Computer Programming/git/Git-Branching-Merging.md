## Introduction

Git is a distributed version control system that enables developers to track changes in code, collaborate efficiently, and experiment safely with new features. One of Git's most powerful capabilities is branching, which allows you to work on different features, bug fixes, or experiments independently from the main codebase.

## What is a Git Branch?

A branch in Git is essentially a lightweight, movable pointer to a specific commit. Think of your project as a timeline of commits where the main branch (typically called `main` or `master`) represents the stable version of your code.

### Visual Representation

```
main:    A---B---C
feature:      \
               D---E
```

In this example:
- `main` points to commit C
- `feature` points to commit E
- Development continues on `feature` without affecting `main`

## Why Use Branches?

Branches provide several key benefits:

- **Feature Development** - Isolate new features from stable code
- **Bug Fixes** - Quickly patch issues without disrupting main development
- **Experiments** - Try new ideas safely without risk
- **Collaboration** - Enable multiple developers to work independently

## Creating and Switching Branches

### Create a New Branch

```bash
git branch feature-login
```

### Switch to a Branch

```bash
git checkout feature-login
```

### Create and Switch in One Command

```bash
git switch -c feature-login
```

### List All Branches

```bash
git branch
```

The asterisk (*) indicates your current branch.

## Common Branching Strategies

### 1. Feature Branch Workflow

Each new feature is developed in its own dedicated branch and merged into main when complete.

```
main
 \
  feature/login
  feature/signup
```

### 2. Git Flow

A structured workflow using multiple branch types:
- `main` - Production-ready code
- `develop` - Integration branch for features
- `feature/*` - Individual feature development
- `release/*` - Prepare new production releases
- `hotfix/*` - Quick fixes for production issues

Ideal for large projects with scheduled releases.

### 3. Forking Workflow

Each developer works in their own forked repository, with changes integrated via pull requests. Common in open-source projects.

## Merging Branches

Merging combines changes from one branch into another.

### Basic Merge

```bash
git checkout main
git merge feature-login
```

### Visual Example

**Before Merge:**
```
main:    A---B---C
feature:      \
               D---E
```

**After Merge:**
```
main:    A---B---C---F
                    ^
                merge commit
```

## Handling Merge Conflicts

Merge conflicts occur when Git cannot automatically combine changes from different branches.

### Example Conflict

```
<<<<<<< main
console.log("Hello from main");
=======
console.log("Hello from feature");
>>>>>>> feature-login
```

### Resolution Steps

1. Open the conflicted file
2. Decide which code to keep (or combine both)
3. Remove conflict markers
4. Save the file
5. Stage and commit:

```bash
git add app.js
git commit
```

## Fast-Forward vs Three-Way Merge

### Fast-Forward Merge

Occurs when the target branch has no new commits since the feature branch was created. Git simply moves the pointer forward.

```bash
git checkout main
git merge feature-login  # Fast-forward
```

### Three-Way Merge

Occurs when both branches have new commits. Git creates a merge commit combining both histories.

## Rebasing

Rebasing moves your branch commits on top of another branch, creating a linear history.

```bash
git checkout feature-login
git rebase main
```

**Benefits:**
- Clean, linear project history
- Easier to follow commit timeline

**Caution:** Avoid rebasing branches that others are working on, as it rewrites commit history.

## Deleting Branches

### Local Branch Deletion

```bash
# Safe delete (only if merged)
git branch -d feature-login

# Force delete
git branch -D feature-login
```

### Remote Branch Deletion

```bash
git push origin --delete feature-login
```

## Best Practices

- **Start Fresh** - Always create branches from the latest `main`
- **Descriptive Names** - Use clear naming conventions (`feature/user-auth`, `bugfix/header-styling`)
- **Stay Current** - Regularly pull changes from `main` to minimize conflicts
- **Careful Conflict Resolution** - Review all changes during conflict resolution
- **Feature-Focused** - Use feature branches for all new development
- **Atomic Commits** - Keep commits small, focused, and meaningful
- **Regular Integration** - Merge or rebase frequently to avoid large conflicts

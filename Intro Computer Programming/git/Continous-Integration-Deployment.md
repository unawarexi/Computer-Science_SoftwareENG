## Introduction

Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment/Delivery (CD) are software engineering practices that allow teams to:

- Automatically build, test, and deploy code
- Detect and fix issues early
- Deliver updates quickly and reliably

Together, CI/CD helps teams maintain high-quality, fast, and predictable software releases.

## What is Continuous Integration (CI)?

CI is the practice of merging code changes frequently into a shared repository.

Every merge triggers automated builds and tests.

CI ensures integration issues are detected early.

### Key Components:

- Version control system (Git)
- Automated build tools
- Automated test suites

## What is Continuous Deployment/Delivery (CD)?

**Continuous Delivery**: Code is automatically built and tested, ready for deployment. Deployment may still require manual approval.

**Continuous Deployment**: Every change that passes CI is automatically deployed to production.

### Benefits:

- Faster release cycles
- Lower risk of errors in production
- High confidence in deployment

## Why CI/CD is Important

- **Early bug detection** — Tests run automatically on each commit
- **Faster release cycles** — Automate build, test, and deployment
- **Consistency** — Standardized deployment process
- **Collaboration** — Team members integrate changes frequently
- **Rollback & traceability** — Easy to track and revert changes if needed

## CI/CD for Different Stacks

### Mobile Development (Android & iOS)

#### Requirements:
- **Build Tools**: Gradle (Android), Xcode (iOS)
- **Stores**: Google Play, Apple App Store
- **CI/CD Tools**: GitHub Actions, Bitrise, CircleCI, Fastlane
- **Testing**: Unit tests, UI tests (Espresso for Android, XCTest for iOS), Beta testing via TestFlight or Firebase App Distribution

#### Workflow Example:
1. Developer pushes code to feature branch
2. CI runs: build APK/IPA, run tests
3. CD deploys to Google Play Beta / TestFlight
4. After approval, CD deploys to production stores

### Web Development (MERN/Next.js)

#### Requirements:
- **Stack**: MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js, Next.js
- **Build Tools**: npm, yarn, Next.js build commands
- **Hosting**: Vercel, Netlify, AWS, Heroku, or Docker containers
- **CI/CD Tools**: GitHub Actions, GitLab CI/CD, Jenkins
- **Testing**: Jest, React Testing Library, Cypress (E2E tests)

#### Workflow Example:
1. Push code to GitHub
2. CI runs: install dependencies, run tests, build production bundle
3. CD deploys to Vercel, Netlify, or Docker container

### Backend Development (Node.js, Python, Java, etc.)

#### Requirements:
- **Stack**: Node.js/Express, Django/Flask, Spring Boot, etc.
- **Databases**: PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, Redis
- **Hosting**: AWS EC2, Heroku, DigitalOcean, Docker containers
- **CI/CD Tools**: GitHub Actions, GitLab CI/CD, Jenkins, CircleCI
- **Testing**: Unit tests (Jest, Mocha, PyTest, JUnit), Integration tests

#### Workflow Example:
1. Developer pushes backend code
2. CI runs: install dependencies, run tests, build Docker image
3. CD deploys Docker container to staging/production

## Containers and Docker in CI/CD

### Why use Docker/containers:
- Standardized environment across development, testing, and production
- Easy to deploy microservices
- Integrates well with CI/CD pipelines

### CI/CD Example with Docker:
1. Build Docker image from Dockerfile in CI
2. Run automated tests inside Docker container
3. Push Docker image to registry (Docker Hub, AWS ECR)
4. Deploy image to Kubernetes, ECS, or other container orchestration platforms

## Automation and Testing in CI/CD

### Automation Tasks:
- Run unit tests automatically
- Run integration tests
- Linting and code formatting checks
- Security scans (Snyk, Dependabot)
- Build and package artifacts (APK, IPA, Docker images)
- Deploy to staging/production automatically

### Testing Levels:
- **Unit Tests**: Test individual components
- **Integration Tests**: Test combined components or services
- **End-to-End (E2E) Tests**: Test full workflows in app
- **UI/UX Tests**: Ensure mobile/web interface works as expected

## Getting Started with CI/CD

### For Beginners:

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with basic build and test automation
2. **Choose Your Platform**: GitHub Actions is great for GitHub repositories
3. **Learn YAML Syntax**: Most CI/CD tools use YAML configuration files
4. **Practice with Templates**: Use existing workflow templates as starting points

### Basic GitHub Actions Example:

```yaml
name: CI/CD Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main, develop ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    
    - name: Setup Node.js
      uses: actions/setup-node@v3
      with:
        node-version: '18'
        
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: npm ci
      
    - name: Run tests
      run: npm test
      
    - name: Build project
      run: npm run build
```

## Common CI/CD Pipeline Examples

### Node.js Web Application:

```yaml
name: Node.js CI/CD

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  build-and-deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    
    - name: Setup Node.js
      uses: actions/setup-node@v3
      with:
        node-version: '18'
        cache: 'npm'
        
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: npm ci
      
    - name: Run linter
      run: npm run lint
      
    - name: Run tests
      run: npm test -- --coverage
      
    - name: Build application
      run: npm run build
      
    - name: Deploy to production
      run: npm run deploy
      env:
        DEPLOY_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.DEPLOY_TOKEN }}
```

### Docker-based Pipeline:

```yaml
name: Docker CI/CD

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  build-and-push:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    
    - name: Build Docker image
      run: docker build -t myapp:${{ github.sha }} .
      
    - name: Run tests in container
      run: docker run --rm myapp:${{ github.sha }} npm test
      
    - name: Login to Docker Hub
      uses: docker/login-action@v2
      with:
        username: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_USERNAME }}
        password: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_PASSWORD }}
        
    - name: Push to Docker Hub
      run: |
        docker tag myapp:${{ github.sha }} myapp:latest
        docker push myapp:${{ github.sha }}
        docker push myapp:latest
```

## Monitoring and Observability

### Key Metrics to Track:
- **Deployment Frequency**: How often you deploy to production
- **Lead Time**: Time from code commit to production deployment
- **Mean Time to Recovery (MTTR)**: Time to recover from failures
- **Change Failure Rate**: Percentage of deployments causing failures

### Tools for Monitoring:
- **Application Performance**: New Relic, Datadog, AppDynamics
- **Infrastructure**: Prometheus, Grafana, CloudWatch
- **Logging**: ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana), Splunk
- **Error Tracking**: Sentry, Rollbar, Bugsnag

## Security in CI/CD

### Security Best Practices:
- **Secret Management**: Use CI/CD platform secret stores, never commit secrets
- **Dependency Scanning**: Automatically scan for vulnerable dependencies
- **Static Code Analysis**: Use tools like SonarQube, CodeQL
- **Container Security**: Scan Docker images for vulnerabilities
- **Access Controls**: Limit who can modify CI/CD pipelines
- **Audit Logs**: Keep detailed logs of all CI/CD activities

### Tools for Security:
- **SAST (Static Analysis)**: SonarQube, Checkmarx, Veracode
- **DAST (Dynamic Analysis)**: OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite
- **Dependency Scanning**: Snyk, WhiteSource, GitHub Dependabot
- **Container Scanning**: Trivy, Clair, Twistlock

## Best Practices

- **Automate as much as possible** — Builds, tests, deployments
- **Keep CI pipelines fast** — Long pipelines slow down development
- **Use separate environments** — Dev, staging, production
- **Fail fast** — Detect errors as early as possible
- **Monitor deployments** — Logs, alerts, dashboards
- **Secure secrets** — API keys, store credentials in CI/CD secret manager
- **Use versioned artifacts** — APKs, Docker images, npm packages
- **Implement proper branching strategy** — GitFlow, GitHub Flow, or trunk-based development
- **Use feature flags** — Enable/disable features without deploying new code
- **Practice blue-green or canary deployments** — Reduce deployment risks
- **Document your pipelines** — Make CI/CD processes clear to all team members
- **Regular pipeline maintenance** — Update dependencies, remove unused steps

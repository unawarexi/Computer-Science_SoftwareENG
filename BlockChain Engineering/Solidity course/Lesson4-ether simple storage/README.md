# Asynchronous Programming in JavaScript

## Asynchronous Programming

Asynchronous programming in JavaScript allows code to execute independently of the main program flow, enabling non-blocking behavior and better handling of tasks like network requests and file I/O.

## async keyword

The `async` keyword is used to define asynchronous functions in JavaScript. It allows functions to return a Promise, simplifying asynchronous code by enabling the use of the `await` keyword within the function.

## Promise in JavaScript

A Promise is an object representing the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation. It provides a cleaner way to deal with asynchronous code compared to using callbacks, by chaining `.then()` and `.catch()` methods.

## await keyword

The `await` keyword is used inside `async` functions to pause execution until a Promise is fulfilled or rejected. It allows asynchronous code to be written in a synchronous-like manner, improving readability and maintainability.

# Compiling our Solidity

## Yarn / npm Install

`yarn and npm install` is a command used with the Yarn package manager to install project dependencies listed in the `package.json` file.

## solc-js

`solc-js` is a JavaScript library for compiling Solidity smart contracts. It allows developers to compile Solidity code into bytecode that can be deployed on the Ethereum blockchain.

## yarn add / npm install solc@0.8.7-fixed

This command installs a specific version of the `solc` package (0.8.7-fixed in this case) using the package managers.

## yarn / npm scripts

Yarn /npm scripts are defined in the `package.json` file and allow you to run predefined commands using the `yarn run` command.

# Ganache & Networks

## Ganache

Ganache is a personal Ethereum blockchain for development purposes. It allows developers to deploy contracts, develop applications, and run tests in a simulated Ethereum environment.

## Networks in MetaMask

MetaMask is a browser extension that allows users to interact with the Ethereum blockchain. It supports different networks, including the Ethereum mainnet, testnets, and custom networks like Ganache.

## RPC URL

RPC `(Remote Procedure Call) URL` is a web address used to connect to a remote server or blockchain node. In the context of Ethereum development,

- it's used to communicate with the Ethereum network, including sending transactions and querying blockchain data.

## Geth

Geth is the command-line interface for running a full Ethereum node.

- It allows developers to interact with the Ethereum network,
- mine Ether,
- deploy contracts, and more.

## JSON RPC Spec Playground

JSON RPC `(Remote Procedure Call)` Spec Playground is a tool for exploring and testing JSON-RPC APIs. In Ethereum development, it can be used to interact with Ethereum nodes via `JSON-RPC requests.`

# Introduction to Ethers.js

## Ethers.js

Ethers.js is a JavaScript library for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain. It provides a simple and efficient API for sending transactions, deploying contracts, and interacting with smart contracts on the Ethereum network.

# Understanding the await Keyword in JavaScript

The `await` keyword is a fundamental aspect of asynchronous programming in JavaScript, particularly when working with promises and asynchronous functions.

- It allows you to pause the execution of an asynchronous function until a promise is resolved or rejected, making it easier to write asynchronous code that resembles synchronous code.

## Adding Transaction Overrides

When interacting with the Ethereum blockchain or other similar networks, you may need to provide transaction overrides to customize the behavior of transactions. These overrides can include options such as gas `price`, `gas limit`, `nonce, and value`.

## Transaction Receipts

Transaction receipts provide information about the outcome of a transaction on the Ethereum blockchain. They contain details such as the

- transaction status,
- gas used,
- contract address (if applicable), and
- logs generated during execution.

## Sending a "Raw" Transaction in Ethers.js

Ethers.js is a popular JavaScript library for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain. It provides a convenient API for sending transactions,

- including support for sending "raw" transactions directly to the network.

## Interacting with Contracts in Ethers.js

One of the key features of Ethers.js is its ability to interact with smart contracts deployed on the Ethereum blockchain.

- It provides methods for deploying new contracts,
- calling contract functions, and
- querying contract state.

## EVM Decompiler

The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) decompiler is a tool used to analyze and understand bytecode generated by Solidity contracts. It can help developers debug and optimize their smart contracts by providing human-readable representations of EVM bytecode.

## BigNumber

BigNumber is a data type used to represent arbitrarily large integers in JavaScript. It is commonly used in blockchain development to handle calculations involving `cryptocurrency balances`, `token amounts`, and `other large numbers`.

## Environment Variables with dotenv

Using environment variables is a best practice for managing configuration values in JavaScript applications. The `dotenv` package allows you to load environment variables from a `.env` file, making it easy to keep sensitive information separate from your code and configure your application across different environments.

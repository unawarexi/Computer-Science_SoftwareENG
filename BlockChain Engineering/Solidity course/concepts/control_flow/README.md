# üß† Solidity Control Flow Guide

This document provides a comprehensive breakdown of **control flow** in Solidity ‚Äî the core structures that determine how code executes, including conditional statements, loops, and flow-altering keywords.

---

## üìå What is Control Flow?

**Control flow** dictates the **order** in which individual statements, instructions, or function calls are executed or evaluated in a program.

In Solidity, control flow includes:

- **Conditional Statements** (`if`, `else`)
- **Loops** (`for`, `while`, `do...while`)
- **Flow-Altering Keywords** (`break`, `continue`, `return`, `revert`, `require`, `assert`)
- **Special Control Statements** (`try-catch`, `fallback`, `receive`)

Understanding control flow is essential for writing secure, efficient, and predictable smart contracts.

## üîÄ Conditional Statements

Conditional statements allow your contract to make decisions based on certain conditions.

### `if`, `else if`, `else`

```solidity
if (a > b) {
    // Code runs if condition is true
} else if (a == b) {
    // Code runs if second condition is true
} else {
    // Code runs if none of the above conditions are true
}
```

- **Conditions must return a `bool`.**
- Solidity does **not** support JavaScript-like "truthy/falsy" values. Only explicit boolean expressions are allowed.

---

## üîÅ Loops in Solidity

Loops let you repeat a block of code multiple times. Use them carefully, as unbounded loops can cause your contract to run out of gas.

### `for` Loop

Use a `for` loop when you know the number of iterations in advance.

```solidity
for (uint i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    // repeated code block
}
```

### `while` Loop

Use a `while` loop when the number of iterations isn't known in advance.

```solidity
uint i = 0;
while (i < 10) {
    // repeated code block
    i++;
}
```

### `do...while` Loop

A `do...while` loop always runs at least once, because the condition is checked after the first iteration.

```solidity
uint i = 0;
do {
    // runs at least once
    i++;
} while (i < 10);
```

> **Note:** `do...while` loops are less common in Solidity, but can be useful if you need the loop body to execute at least once.

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Gas Warning

- **Loops can be dangerous** due to unbounded gas usage.
- Always **limit the number of iterations** or use loops only for reading data (view/pure functions).
- **Avoid writing to large storage arrays in loops** ‚Äî this can lead to out-of-gas errors and failed transactions.

---

## üö¶ Flow-Altering Keywords

These keywords change the normal flow of execution in your contract.

### `break`

Exits the loop early.

```solidity
for (uint i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    if (i == 5) {
        break; // Exit loop when i == 5
    }
}
```

### `continue`

Skips the current iteration and continues to the next.

```solidity
for (uint i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    if (i % 2 == 0) {
        continue; // Skip even numbers
    }
    // Code here runs only for odd i
}
```

### `return`

Exits the current function and returns control (and optionally a value) to the caller.

```solidity
function get() public pure returns (uint) {
    return 42;
}
```

### `revert()`

Stops execution and reverts all state changes, optionally with an error message.

```solidity
revert("Something went wrong");
```

### `require()`

Checks a condition and reverts if false. Commonly used for input validation and access control.

```solidity
require(msg.sender == owner, "Not authorized");
```

### `assert()`

Used to check for conditions that should **never** be false (internal errors or invariants). If the condition fails, all gas is consumed.

```solidity
assert(balance >= 0); // Should never fail
```

---

## üõ†Ô∏è `try-catch` for External Calls

Solidity (since v0.6.0) supports `try-catch` for error handling in **external calls** or contract creation.

```solidity
try otherContract.someFunction() returns (uint value) {
    // success logic
} catch Error(string memory reason) {
    // catch require/revert errors (with error message)
} catch (bytes memory lowLevelData) {
    // catch assert/panic errors (no error message)
}
```

- Use `try-catch` to handle failures gracefully when calling other contracts.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Special Functions in Control Flow

### `fallback()`

A special function that is called when:

- No other function matches the call data.
- No `receive()` function is defined for plain Ether transfers.

```solidity
fallback() external {
    // logic
}
```

### `receive()`

A special function to **receive Ether**. Must be `external` and `payable`.

```solidity
receive() external payable {
    // logic to handle received Ether
}
```

---

## üß™ Examples and Gotchas

### ‚ùå Infinite Loop Risk

```solidity
// Dangerous - can cause out-of-gas error
while (true) {
    // no exit condition
}
```

- **Never** write loops without a clear exit condition.

### ‚úÖ Controlled Loop

```solidity
for (uint i = 0; i < myArray.length && i < 10; i++) {
    // safe bounded loop
}
```

- Always **bound** your loops to avoid excessive gas usage.

---

## üß† Best Practices

- ‚úÖ **Always bound loops** (e.g., `i < 10`).
- ‚úÖ **Use `require()` for input checks** and access control.
- ‚úÖ **Avoid heavy computation in loops**.
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Don‚Äôt use loops to write to large storage arrays**.
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Prefer off-chain computation** for large or complex operations.

## üîö Conclusion

Control flow structures are essential to write secure, efficient, and predictable smart contracts in Solidity. Mastering them allows you to:

- Study function modifiers and how to apply them.

### Day 5: Mappings and Arrays

- Learn how mappings and arrays work in Solidity.
- Understand dynamic and fixed-size arrays.
- Create a contract that uses mappings for storing key-value pairs.
- Learn about iterating over arrays and how mappings cannot be iterated.

### Day 6: Events and Logging

- Learn about Solidity events and how they are used for logging.
- Understand how events help communicate data to the blockchain.
- Write a contract that emits events when certain actions are performed.

### Day 7: Practice and Review

- Review all concepts learned during the week.
- Build a simple smart contract with variables, mappings, arrays, functions, and events (e.g., a "To-Do List" contract).

## Week 2: Intermediate Solidity Concepts

### Day 8: Inheritance and Contracts Interactions

- Learn about Solidityâ€™s inheritance model.
- Understand how contracts can inherit from other contracts.
- Study `is`, `super`, and method overriding.
- Write contracts with basic inheritance.

### Day 9: Interfaces and Abstract Contracts

- Learn the difference between interfaces and abstract contracts.
- Explore how to create and implement interfaces.
- Understand abstract contracts and when to use them.
- Write a contract that uses interfaces and interacts with another contract.

### Day 10: Constructors and Initialization

- Learn about constructors and how they are used to initialize contracts.
- Understand how constructor parameters work.
- Write a contract that uses a constructor for initializing variables.

### Day 11: Payable Functions and Ether Transfers

- Understand how to transfer Ether between accounts and contracts.
- Learn about `payable` functions and the `msg` object (e.g., `msg.sender`, `msg.value`).
- Write a contract that accepts Ether payments and transfers funds between addresses.

### Day 12: Gas, Optimizations, and Best Practices

- Learn about gas and how it affects smart contract execution.
- Study gas optimization techniques.
- Explore Solidity best practices, such as avoiding reentrancy attacks, avoiding infinite loops, etc.

### Day 13: Error Handling and Exceptions

- Understand error handling mechanisms in Solidity (`require`, `assert`, and `revert`).
- Write a contract that demonstrates different ways to handle errors and failed transactions.

### Day 14: Practice and Review

- Review all intermediate concepts.
- Build a smart contract that involves payable functions, inheritance, and error handling (e.g., a crowdfunding contract).

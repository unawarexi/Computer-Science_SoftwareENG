- **Importing from GitHub & NPM:** Developers can import Solidity contracts or libraries from GitHub repositories or NPM, facilitating code reuse.
- **Chainlink NPM Package:** Chainlink offers an NPM package for easy access to its functionality in Solidity projects.

## Floating Point Math in Solidity
- **tuple:** A data structure in Solidity used to group together multiple variables of possibly different types under a single name.
- **Floating Point Numbers in Solidity:** Explanation of how floating-point arithmetic works in Solidity, including its limitations and potential issues.
- **Type Casting:** The process of converting a variable from one data type to another, often necessary in Solidity due to its strict typing system.

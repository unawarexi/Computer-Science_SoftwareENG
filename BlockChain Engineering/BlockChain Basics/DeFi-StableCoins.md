# DeFi Stablecoins Overview

##  What Are Stablecoins?

**Stablecoins** are cryptocurrencies pegged to a stable asset, most commonly **fiat currencies** like the **US Dollar (USD)**, **Euro (EUR)**, or **gold**. In **DeFi**, they enable users to:
- Avoid crypto volatility
- Lend/borrow assets
- Participate in yield farming
- Provide liquidity without large risk exposure

## Categories of Stablecoins

| Type                     | Peg Mechanism                                 | Example Tokens        | Notes                                                 |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| **Fiat-Backed (Custodial)** | Backed 1:1 with fiat in banks(exogenous)                  | USDC, USDT, BUSD       | Centralized; requires trust in issuer (Circle, Tether) |
| **Crypto-Backed**         | Overcollateralized with crypto assets(endogenous)          | DAI, LUSD, MIM         | Decentralized; resilient but volatile collateral        |
| **Algorithmic**           | Supply adjusted algorithmically                | FRAX, GHO, USDN (failed) | High risk; some have failed due to peg instability     |
| **Hybrid**                | Combines crypto collateral + algorithmic logic | FRAX, sUSD             | Balanced model to improve stability and scalability    |
| **Commodity-Backed**      | Pegged to physical assets like gold(exogenous)          | PAXG, XAUT              | Tokenized assets; not widely used in DeFi yet          |

|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|

| **Collateral**          | Used as collateral in DeFi lending/borrowing (e.g., DAI in Aave).          |
| **Liquidity**           | Paired with volatile assets in liquidity pools for trading.                |
| **Yield Farming**       | Earn passive income via stablecoin lending or pool farming.                |
| **Payments**            | Fast, borderless payments with minimal volatility.                         |
| **Stability in Volatility** | Safe haven asset during market downturns.                                 |

##  Collateralization Mechanisms

| Mechanism                | How it Works                                                     | Example Tokens      |
|--------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|
| **Overcollateralized**    | Lock $150+ to mint $100 stablecoin                              | DAI, LUSD, MIM      |
| **Partially Collateralized** | Minted based on part collateral, part algorithmic backing      | FRAX                |
| **Fully Algorithmic**     | Uses rebasing or supply expansion/contraction to maintain peg   | UST (failed), GHO   |
| **Synthetic/Future Yield**| Loans repaid via deposited yield over time                      | alUSD               |
| **Staked Collateral**     | Uses aToken or LST (e.g. stETH) as minting collateral           | GHO, crvUSD         |

## DeFi Stablecoins in Liquidity & Lending

- **Aave & Compound:** DAI, USDC, USDT are top borrowed/lent assets.
- **Curve Finance:** DAI/USDC/USDT pools dominate TVL.
- **Balancer & FraxBP Pools:** Combine stablecoins for low-slippage swaps.
- **Alchemix:** Use yield-bearing collateral (e.g., Yearn vaults) to mint alUSD.
- **Liquity:** Offers interest-free loans with LUSD, liquidated via Stability Pools.

## Examples of DeFi Stablecoin Use Flows

### Lending Flow:
User deposits ETH -> Mints DAI -> Lends DAI on Aave -> Earns yield

```shell
### Lending Flow:
```


### Trading Flow:
User swaps ETH to USDC -> Uses USDC to LP on Uniswap -> Earns fees

```shell

### Trading Flow:
```

### Self-Repaying Loan (Alchemix):
Deposit DAI -> Mint alUSD -> Yield from Yearn auto-pays debt over time

```yaml
### Self-Repaying Loan (Alchemix):
```

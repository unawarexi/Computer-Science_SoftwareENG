# Blockchain DeFi Overview

##  What is DeFi?

**DeFi (Decentralized Finance)** refers to a broad category of financial applications built on blockchain networks that operate **without traditional intermediaries** like banks or brokers. It leverages smart contracts (mainly on Ethereum and other EVM-compatible chains) to automate and decentralize financial services.

## Core Concepts of DeFi

| Concept                | Description                                                                 |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Smart Contracts**     | Self-executing contracts coded on blockchains (e.g., Solidity on Ethereum). |
| **Liquidity Pools**     | Pools of tokens locked in smart contracts to enable decentralized trading.  |
| **Yield Farming**       | Earning rewards (interest or tokens) for providing liquidity or staking.     |
| **Lending & Borrowing** | Peer-to-peer lending without a centralized authority.                       |
| **Stablecoins**         | Cryptocurrencies pegged to real-world assets like USD (e.g., USDC, DAI).   |
| **Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs)** | Platforms that allow crypto trading directly between users.          |
| **Governance Tokens**   | Tokens that allow holders to vote on protocol decisions (e.g., MKR, AAVE).  |
| **Bridges**             | Cross-chain tools to transfer assets between different blockchains.         |

## Advantages of DeFi

-**Permissionless:** No need for approval from intermediaries.
-**Transparency:** All transactions are on-chain and verifiable.
-**Global Access:** Anyone with internet and a crypto wallet can access DeFi.
-**Interoperability:** DeFi protocols are composable ("money legos").

## Risks in DeFi

-  Smart contract vulnerabilities
-  Impermanent loss in liquidity pools
-  Rug pulls and malicious governance
-  High gas fees (especially on Ethereum L1)
-  Oracle manipulation and front-running

## Getting Started with DeFi

1.Create a non-custodial wallet (e.g., MetaMask, Trust Wallet).
2. Fund with ETH or other native assets.
3. Choose a protocol (Aave, Uniswap, Lido, etc.).
4. Interact via dApp or directly through smart contracts.
5. Stay safe: use hardware wallets, avoid unknown dApps, and verify contracts.

# Examples of Layer 2 Solutions and Their Compatible Blockchains

Layer 2 (L2) solutions are designed to scale blockchain networks by moving transactions off-chain, while still relying on the security and decentralization of the Layer 1 (L1) base layer. These L2 solutions often offer faster transaction throughput, lower fees, and enhanced scalability for decentralized applications (dApps).

Below is a list of prominent L2 solutions and the blockchains they are compatible with.

## Optimism

- **Blockchain**: Ethereum
- **Type**: Optimistic Rollup
- **Description**: Optimism is an Ethereum Layer 2 solution that uses optimistic rollups to increase scalability and lower transaction costs. It assumes transactions are valid by default and only uses fraud proofs to challenge potentially fraudulent ones.

# ðŸ“š Introduction to NestJS

## What is NestJS?

NestJS is a **progressive Node.js framework** for building efficient and scalable **server-side applications**. It is built with **TypeScript** and follows **Angular's architecture** principles, providing an out-of-the-box application structure that helps in building modular, maintainable, and scalable apps.

## When to Use NestJS?

You should consider using NestJS when:

- You are building **server-side applications** that need a robust, scalable, and maintainable architecture.
- You want to leverage the power of **TypeScript** for improved code quality and early error detection.
- You need to create **RESTful APIs**, **microservices**, or **GraphQL** applications.
- You need a **modular** design to manage complex features or services in large-scale applications.

## Where to Use NestJS?

NestJS can be used in various types of projects, such as:

- **Web applications:** API servers, web backends, or full-stack apps.
- **Microservices architectures:** Using NestJSâ€™s built-in support for microservices to create distributed systems.
- **GraphQL APIs:** Easily create GraphQL APIs with the help of built-in integrations.
- **Real-time applications:** Ideal for building apps that require WebSockets, such as chat systems or live notifications.

## How Does NestJS Work?

NestJS works by using a **modular architecture** to divide your app into cohesive modules that handle different concerns. It uses **controllers** to handle HTTP requests and **services** to manage business logic, all while leveraging **dependency injection** to manage these components efficiently. This enables you to organize your code in a clean, scalable manner.

## Why Choose NestJS?

- **Scalability:** It encourages modular design, making it easier to scale applications and manage complexity.
- **Built-in features:** NestJS comes with features like routing, middleware, guards, pipes, and validation out of the box, reducing the need for additional dependencies.
- **TypeScript support:** It is designed to be fully compatible with TypeScript, providing strong typing and modern JavaScript features.
- **Ecosystem support:** It supports integration with popular libraries like TypeORM, Mongoose, and others, offering a rich ecosystem.
- **Microservices-friendly:** Out of the box, NestJS has tools and patterns for building microservices architectures, making it easy to develop distributed systems.

## Who Uses NestJS?

NestJS is used by:

- **Backend developers** who want to build scalable, maintainable, and efficient server-side applications using modern design patterns.
- **Full-stack developers** who need to create robust APIs for their web or mobile applications.
- **Large-scale enterprises** that require a structured framework for building scalable systems.
- **Startups** and **developers** looking for a TypeScript-based framework that can handle everything from small APIs to complex, microservices-based applications.

| `vm`             | Executes JavaScript code within a V8 virtual machine sandbox.               |
| `child_process`  | Enables spawning new processes and communicating with them.                 |
| `cluster`        | Used to create child processes that can share server ports.                 |
| `readline`       | Provides an interface for reading input from a readable stream like stdin.  |
| `timers`         | Provides functions like `setTimeout`, `setInterval`, and `setImmediate`.     |

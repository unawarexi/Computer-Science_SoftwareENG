- Reading and Writing Files
- Working with Directories
- Introduction to HTTP Module
- Building a Simple HTTP Server

### Steps:
1. **File System**: Learn how to interact with the file system using the `fs` module (`readFile`, `writeFile`, `appendFile`, etc.).
2. **Directories**: Work with directories by creating, reading, and deleting them.
3. **HTTP Module**: Get introduced to the built-in `http` module and its role in creating servers.
4. **Building a Server**: Create a simple web server using Node.js to handle basic HTTP requests and responses.

### Practice:
- Build a basic Node.js server that serves HTML content.
- Create a simple file I/O application that reads from and writes to text files.

## Week 3: Introduction to Express.js

### Topics:
- Setting up Express.js
- Basic Routing in Express
- Middleware in Express
- Serving Static Files
- Error Handling

### Steps:
1. **Installing Express.js**: Install and set up an Express.js project.
2. **Routing**: Learn how to define and handle routes (`GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`).
3. **Middleware**: Understand how middleware works in Express and how to use built-in middleware (`express.json()`, `express.urlencoded()`).
4. **Static Files**: Serve static files (HTML, CSS, images) with `express.static()`.
5. **Error Handling**: Implement basic error-handling middleware.

### Practice:
- Build a basic Express app that serves static files and has multiple routes.
- Implement custom error-handling middleware for 404 pages.

## Week 4: Working with Templating Engines

### Topics:
- What are Templating Engines?
- EJS (Embedded JavaScript)
- Handlebars (Optional)
- Rendering Dynamic Content
- Layouts and Partials

### Steps:
1. **Templating Engines**: Learn what templating engines are and why they're useful in server-side rendering.
2. **EJS**: Install and use EJS to render dynamic content in Express.
3. **Dynamic Content**: Learn how to pass data from your Express server to your views.
4. **Layouts and Partials**: Implement layouts and partials to avoid repetitive HTML code.

### Practice:
- Build a blog application with Express and EJS, rendering posts dynamically from the server.
- Use layouts and partials for the blog’s header and footer.

## Week 5: Working with Databases (MongoDB and Mongoose)

### Topics:
- Introduction to MongoDB (NoSQL)
- Setting Up MongoDB (Locally or Cloud-based)
- CRUD Operations with MongoDB
- Mongoose ODM (Object Data Modeling)
- Defining Schemas and Models

### Steps:
1. **Introduction to MongoDB**: Learn the basics of NoSQL databases and MongoDB.
2. **Setting Up MongoDB**: Set up MongoDB locally or using cloud services like MongoDB Atlas.
3. **CRUD Operations**: Perform basic `create`, `read`, `update`, and `delete` operations using MongoDB’s native drivers or Mongoose.
4. **Mongoose**: Install and configure Mongoose for interacting with MongoDB in a structured manner.
5. **Schemas and Models**: Define Mongoose schemas and models for structuring your data.

### Practice:
- Build a simple REST API using Express and MongoDB to perform CRUD operations.
- Use Mongoose to define a schema for users or posts.

## Week 6: Authentication and Authorization

### Topics:
- User Authentication (Signup, Login)
- Hashing Passwords with bcrypt
- Sessions and Cookies
- JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
- Role-based Authorization

### Steps:
1. **User Authentication**: Implement signup and login functionality with Express.
2. **Hashing Passwords**: Use `bcrypt` to securely hash and store passwords.
3. **Sessions and Cookies**: Learn how to use sessions and cookies for maintaining user authentication state.
4. **JWT**: Use JSON Web Tokens for stateless authentication.
5. **Role-based Authorization**: Implement role-based access control for different parts of your app.

### Practice:
- Create a user authentication system with JWT and bcrypt.
- Implement role-based authorization to restrict access to certain routes.

## Week 7: Building and Consuming APIs

### Topics:
- REST API Principles
- Building RESTful APIs with Express
- Handling HTTP Methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- Versioning APIs
- Testing APIs with Postman or Insomnia

### Steps:
1. **REST API Principles**: Learn about REST architecture and best practices for API design.
2. **Building REST APIs**: Build a full-featured REST API using Express.
3. **Handling HTTP Methods**: Learn how to handle `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, and `DELETE` requests.
4. **Versioning**: Implement API versioning strategies.
5. **Testing**: Test your API endpoints using tools like Postman or Insomnia.

### Practice:

3. **Project Structure**: Explore the file and folder structure of a Next.js project.
4. **Pages and Routing**: Learn how Next.js uses file-based routing to map pages to URLs.
5. **Running the Server**: Start the development server and explore hot-reloading features.

### Practice:

- Global CSS and Styled JSX
- Tailwind CSS with Next.js (optional)

### Steps:
1. **React Components**: Review how to create and use React components in Next.js.
2. **Layouts**: Implement layouts to reuse header, footer, and other components across multiple pages.
3. **CSS Modules**: Learn how to use CSS Modules for scoped styling in Next.js.
4. **Global CSS**: Set up global styles and learn how to handle styling across the project.
5. **Tailwind CSS**: Optionally, install and configure Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling.

### Practice:
- Create a reusable layout component.
- Apply both scoped and global styles to your Next.js pages.
- Style your project with Tailwind CSS for a modern, responsive design.

## Week 3: Data Fetching in Next.js

### Topics:
- Static Generation (`getStaticProps`)
- Server-side Rendering (`getServerSideProps`)
- Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)
- Client-side Data Fetching (`useEffect` and `SWR`)

### Steps:
1. **Static Generation**: Learn how to use `getStaticProps` to fetch data at build time.
2. **Server-side Rendering**: Use `getServerSideProps` to fetch data on each request for dynamic content.
3. **Incremental Static Regeneration**: Learn about ISR for automatically updating static pages.
4. **Client-side Data Fetching**: Use `useEffect` for client-side fetching and explore the `SWR` library for better client-side data management.

### Practice:
- Build pages that fetch and display data from a public API using both static generation and server-side rendering.
- Implement client-side fetching with `useEffect` or `SWR`.

## Week 4: Dynamic Routing and API Routes

### Topics:
- Dynamic Routing and Catch-all Routes
- Dynamic Imports
- API Routes in Next.js
- Environment Variables and Configurations

### Steps:
1. **Dynamic Routing**: Set up dynamic routes using file and folder naming conventions (e.g., `[id].js`).
2. **Catch-all Routes**: Learn how to handle flexible routing using catch-all routes.
3. **API Routes**: Create custom API endpoints directly within your Next.js project using `pages/api`.
4. **Environment Variables**: Learn how to set up environment variables for secure API keys and configurations.

### Practice:
- Create dynamic routes for blog posts or products.
- Build API routes for basic CRUD functionality (e.g., fetching data from an external API).
- Secure your API keys using environment variables.

## Week 5: Image Optimization and Middleware

### Topics:
- Next.js Image Optimization (`next/image`)
- Middleware in Next.js
- Redirects and Rewrites
- Head Metadata (`next/head`)
- Custom Document and App (`_document.js` and `_app.js`)

### Steps:
1. **Image Optimization**: Use the built-in `next/image` component for optimized image loading and automatic resizing.
2. **Middleware**: Learn how to use middleware for tasks like authentication and logging.
3. **Redirects and Rewrites**: Configure redirects and rewrites to manage complex routing.
4. **Metadata**: Add metadata to your pages using `next/head`.
5. **Custom `_app.js` and `_document.js`**: Customize your app’s root structure and document.

### Practice:
- Optimize images across your Next.js app using `next/image`.
- Implement middleware for user authentication or other pre-route logic.
- Add SEO-friendly metadata to your pages using `next/head`.

## Week 6: Authentication and State Management

### Topics:
- Introduction to Authentication in Next.js
- Third-party Authentication (NextAuth.js, Firebase Auth)
- State Management in Next.js (Context API, Redux, Zustand)
- Protecting Routes (Auth Guard)

### Steps:
1. **Authentication**: Implement user authentication using libraries like NextAuth.js or Firebase Authentication.
2. **Third-party Logins**: Add OAuth login functionality (e.g., Google, GitHub).
3. **State Management**: Explore different state management approaches in Next.js such as the Context API, Redux, or Zustand.
4. **Protected Routes**: Set up route guards to protect certain pages based on user authentication status.

### Practice:
- Add login and signup pages with third-party authentication.
- Implement a simple global state for user data using Redux or the Context API.
- Protect specific routes so only logged-in users can access them.

## Week 7: Internationalization, Testing, and Performance Optimization

### Topics:
- Internationalization (i18n)
- Unit and Integration Testing in Next.js (Jest, React Testing Library)
- Performance Optimization in Next.js
- Web Vitals and Lighthouse Performance Audits

### Steps:
1. **Internationalization (i18n)**: Learn how to build multi-language apps using Next.js’s built-in internationalization features.
2. **Testing**: Write unit and integration tests for components and pages using Jest and React Testing Library.
3. **Performance Optimization**: Optimize your Next.js application for faster load times (e.g., lazy loading, code splitting, and image optimization).
4. **Web Vitals**: Use Google’s Web Vitals and Lighthouse to measure and optimize your app’s performance.

### Practice:
- Add internationalization to your app and provide translations for multiple languages.
- Write tests for key components and ensure your app performs well under different scenarios.
- Conduct a performance audit using Lighthouse and improve metrics.

## Week 8: Deploying and Monitoring Next.js Applications

### Topics:
- Deployment Platforms (Vercel, Netlify)
- CI/CD Pipeline Setup
- Monitoring and Error Tracking (Sentry, LogRocket)
- Analytics with Next.js

### Steps:

## Exception Handling
In Dart, exceptions are used to `handle runtime` or `compile time errors` in a safe manner.

- **try-catch**
Use try and catch to handle exceptions that might occur in your code.

- **finally**
The finally block is executed after `try-catch`, whether an exception was thrown or not. It's typically used for cleanup.


## Asynchronous Control Flows
Dart has built-in support for asynchronous programming, which is particularly useful in Flutter apps where many operations (like network requests) happen asynchronously.

- **async and await**
Use async to mark a function as asynchronous and await to wait for an asynchronous operation to complete.

## Future
A Future represents a potential value or error that will be available at some time in the future.

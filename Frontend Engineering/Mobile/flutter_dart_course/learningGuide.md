- Constructors
- Inheritance
- Mixins
- Interfaces and Abstract Classes

### Steps:
1. **Classes and Objects**: Learn how to define classes and create objects.
2. **Constructors**: Understand default, named, and factory constructors.
3. **Inheritance**: Implement inheritance and explore `super` and `override` keywords.
4. **Mixins**: Use mixins for sharing code across classes.
5. **Interfaces & Abstract Classes**: Learn about abstract classes and interfaces for code structure.

## Week 4: Layouts and Navigation

### Topics:
- Layouts in Flutter (Container, Padding, Row, Column)
- Stack and ListView
- Navigator and Routing
- Material Design Principles

### Steps:
1. **Layouts in Flutter**: Master basic layout widgets (`Container`, `Padding`, `Row`, `Column`).
2. **Advanced Layouts**: Explore `Stack` and `ListView` for more complex UIs.
3. **Navigation**: Learn how to navigate between screens using the `Navigator` widget and routing.
4. **Material Design**: Implement Material Design components in your app.

## Week 5: State Management in Flutter

### Topics:
- Stateful Widgets and setState
- Lifting State Up
- InheritedWidget
- Provider Package (Intro)

### Steps:
1. **Stateful Widgets**: Understand how `setState` updates the UI.
2. **Lifting State Up**: Learn how to share state between widgets.
3. **InheritedWidget**: Use `InheritedWidget` to share data between widgets.
4. **Provider**: Get started with `Provider` for state management.

### Practice:

## Week 6: Handling Forms, Input, and Validation

### Topics:
- Text Input Fields
- Form Validation
- Handling User Input
- Keyboard Actions

### Steps:
1. **TextFields**: Learn how to accept user input using `TextField`.
2. **Forms and Validation**: Create forms and validate user input.
3. **Handling Input**: Handle button clicks and other interactions.
4. **Keyboard Actions**: Manage keyboard actions and focus control.

### Practice:
- Build a login form with validation and error handling.
- Create a registration form with email, password, and name fields.

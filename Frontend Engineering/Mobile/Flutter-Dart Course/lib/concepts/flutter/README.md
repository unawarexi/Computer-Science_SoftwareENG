| `Widget`         | Basic building block of Flutter UI                                                | Missing required attributes or incorrect use of stateless/stateful widgets      | Ensure correct widget usage and required parameters are passed when constructing.                                                                  |
| `BuildContext`   | Reference to the location of a widget in the widget tree                          | Context lookup issues or accessing context before widget initialization         | Ensure context is available and used correctly, especially in `State` objects.                                                                      |
| `Scaffold`       | Provides structure for a basic Flutter app layout (app bar, drawer, bottom nav)    | Missing body or incorrect use of `Scaffold` attributes                         | Ensure all required attributes are included, like `body`, `appBar`, and `drawer`.                                                                  |
| `State`          | Used in Stateful widgets to store and manage dynamic data                         | Misuse of `setState()` or improper state handling                               | Ensure `setState()` is used correctly and state is updated only in `State` objects.                                                                 |
| `Future`         | Represents a value that will be available at a later point in time                | Not using `await` with `Future` or ignoring the result of `Future` functions    | Always await `Future` functions or use `.then()` for handling results.                                                                              |
| `Stream`         | Asynchronous sequence of data                                                      | Improper subscription to streams or missing stream listeners                    | Ensure proper stream subscription using `StreamBuilder` or manually subscribing and handling results.                                               |

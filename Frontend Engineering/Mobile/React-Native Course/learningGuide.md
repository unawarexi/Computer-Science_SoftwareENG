### Steps:
1. **State and Props**: Review how React Native handles component state and props.
2. **Context API**: Use Context API to manage state globally across components.
3. **AsyncStorage**: Store persistent data using `AsyncStorage` (key-value storage).
4. **Introduction to Redux**: Install and configure Redux for state management.
5. **Managing Forms**: Handle input fields and forms using state.

### Practice:

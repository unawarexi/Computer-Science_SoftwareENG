## Introduction to Algorithms

In computer science, an **algorithm** is a set of well-defined instructions or a step-by-step procedure to solve a specific problem or perform a task. Algorithms are fundamental to all areas of computer science and are used to manipulate data, perform computations, and automate reasoning tasks.

## Definition of an Algorithm

An **algorithm** can be defined as:

> A finite sequence of well-defined, computer-implementable instructions, typically to solve a class of problems or to perform a computation.

Algorithms are independent of programming languages; they are simply the logic required to perform tasks. They can be expressed in pseudocode, flowcharts, or any programming language (in this case, Python).

## Properties of Algorithms

For a procedure to be considered an algorithm, it must have the following five essential properties:

### 1. Input

An algorithm should have 0 or more well-defined inputs. These inputs are taken from a specified set of data.

### 2. Output

An algorithm should produce at least one output. The output is the solution or result derived from processing the inputs.

### 3. Definiteness

Each step of the algorithm must be clearly and unambiguously defined. The operations must be rigorously specified to ensure no confusion.

### 4. Finiteness

An algorithm must always terminate after a finite number of steps. It should not run indefinitely.

### 5. Effectiveness

The steps of the algorithm must be basic enough that they can, in principle, be carried out by a person using only pen and paper. In other words, they must be feasible and executable.

## Examples of Algorithms

### Example 1: Linear Search Algorithm

The **Linear Search** algorithm is a simple searching algorithm that checks each element in a list sequentially until the desired element is found or the list ends.

#### Properties Check:

- **Input**: List of elements and the target value to be searched.
- **Output**: Index of the target value if found; otherwise, an indication that the target is not in the list.
- **Definiteness**: Each step is clearly defined (i.e., check each element).
- **Finiteness**: Ends after all elements have been checked.
- **Effectiveness**: Simple comparison operations.

#### Python Implementation:

```python
def linear_search(arr, target):
    for index, value in enumerate(arr):
        if value == target:
            return index  # Output: Index of the target value
    return -1  # Output: Indication that target is not found

# Example usage:
arr = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
target = 5
result = linear_search(arr, target)
print(f"Linear Search Result: Element found at index {result}")  # Output: Element found at index 2
```

## Binary Search Algorithm

The **Binary Search algorithm is a more efficient search algorithm** that works on `sorted lists`. It repeatedly divides the search interval in half and compares the middle element with the target.

Properties Check:

- **Input**: Sorted list of elements and the target value to be searched.
- **Output**: Index of the target value if found; otherwise, an indication that the target is not in the list.
- **Definiteness**: Each step (compare and divide) is clearly defined.
- **Finiteness**: Terminates after reducing the search space to zero.
- **Effectiveness**: Simple comparison and division operations.

```python
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1
    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid  # Output: Index of the target value
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    return -1  # Output: Indication that target is not found

# Example usage:
arr = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
target = 7
result = binary_search(arr, target)
print(f"Binary Search Result: Element found at index {result}")  # Output: Element found at index 3
```

## Factorial Calculation Using Recursion

A Factorial algorithm calculates the product of all positive integers less than or equal to a given positive integer n. The factorial of n is denoted as n!.

Properties Check:

- **Input**: A non-negative integer n.
- **Output**: The factorial value of n.
- **Definiteness**: Steps are clearly defined (recursive multiplication).
- **Finiteness**: Ends when n is reduced to 1.
- **Effectiveness**: Basic multiplication operations.

Python Implementation:

```python
Copy code
def factorial(n):
    if n == 0 or n == 1:
        return 1  # Base case
    else:
        return n * factorial(n - 1)  # Recursive case

# Example usage:
n = 5
result = factorial(n)
print(f"Factorial of {n} is {result}")  # Output: Factorial of 5 is 120
```
